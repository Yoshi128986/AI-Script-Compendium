# AI-Script-Compendium
Here is a list of all script that is posted in `#ai-scripts` channel in the FSS Discord Server.

Doesn't include scripts for using skills in Tower Testing, since they should be paired with a certain bp to use.

Doesn't include scripts that is made to pair with another existing script.

Doesn't include scripts that I think is too useless.

All scripts are sorted based on their category, then release date.

### Script Special List
- `Turbo vX`: Requires having the Turbo Exec vX pack imported and enabled.
- `Turbo vX Opt`: This script work without Turbo exec vX, but work faster if it is used.
- `Parallels`: This script accelerates itself by calling multiple instances of itself, faster than normal script but usually not as fast as turbo.
- `Turbo Own`: This script uses own build-in Turbo exec version to accelerate, therefore it isn't working with Turbo exec v1 enabled.
